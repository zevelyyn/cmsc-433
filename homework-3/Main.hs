This is the first homework assignment for CMSC 433. It provides
practice with the basic built-in data structures of Haskell, including
lists, tuples and maybes, as well as recursion and pattern
matching. It also covers the basics of Haskell code style and
test-driven development. If you have not read the Basics module, and
completed the associated quiz, you should do that first.

This page is a "literate" Haskell program, meaning that explanation is
interspersed with actual Haskell code. To complete your assignment,
edit Main.hs and submit it through Gradescope.

This file starts by first declaring that we are creating a module
called Main and are using functions defined in the modules Prelude,
Test.HUnit, Data.List and Data.Char.

The Prelude line imports all except for the functions listed (which
you will write). The module Prelude is special in that it is always
imported by default, so the the point of this line is not to import
more functions, but rather to exclude a few functions. (Haskell does
not allow functions to be redefined in the same module.)

The Test.HUnit line imports all functions defined in that module. The
line Data.List imports all functions from that module, but makes them
available with qualified names, such as List.intersperse, etc.

-}

module Main where
import Prelude hiding (reverse, concat, zip, (++), takeWhile, all)
import Test.HUnit

{-
The main "entry point" for this assignment runs the tests for each
homework problem below. You should not edit this definition. Instead,
your goal is to modify the problems below so that all of the tests
pass. Note that the definitions in Haskell modules do not need to come
in any particular order; here, the main function uses the definitions
testStyle, testLists, etc, even though their definitions come much
later in the file.
-} 

main :: IO ()
main = do
  runTestTT testStyle
  runTestTT testLists
  -- runTestTT testHO
  -- runTestTT testFoldr
  -- runTestTT testTree
  return ()

{-

Now that we have the preliminaries out of the way, we can start the actual problems.

Recall that you can load this file into ghci with the command stack
ghci Main.hs. Or, you can build the executable first with stack build
and then run the test cases above with the command line stack exec --
hw01. (For each of these, make sure that you are in the hw01
subdirectory.)

-- Problem (Good Style)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

testStyle :: Test
testStyle = "testStyle" ~:
   TestList [ tabc , tarithmetic, treverse, tzip ]

{-

All of the following Haskell code does what it is supposed to do
(i.e. the tests pass), but it is difficult to read. Rewrite the
following expressions so that they exactly follow the style guide. Be
careful: the style guide includes quite a few rules, and we've broken
most of them in what follows! (You don't need to rewrite the test
following each part, but you do need to make sure that you don't break
the code as you refactor it!)

NOTE: Do not change the name of any of the top level declarations
below, even if you think that they aren't very good (they aren't). We
will be using automatic testing to ensure that you do not break
anything when you rewrite these functions. On the other hand, local
variables (such as function parameters and those bound by let and
where) can and should be renamed.

-- Problem (List library chops)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

{-

Define, debug and test the following functions. Some of these
functions are part of the Haskell standard prelude or standard
libraries like Data.List. Their solutions are readily available
online. You should not google for this code: instead, implement them
yourself.

For each part of this problem, you should replace the testcase for
that part based on the description in the comments. Make sure to test
with multiple inputs using TestList. We will be grading your test
cases as well as the correctness and style of your solutions! HINT:
your testing code should include any tests that we give you in the the
comments!

Do not use any list library functions in this problem. This includes
any function from the Prelude or from Data.List thats take arguments
or returns a result with a list type. Note that (:) and [] are data
constructors for the list type, not functions, so you are free to use
them. Please also avoid list comprehension syntax, as it actually
de-sugars into library functions! This also includes foldr/map/etc.
You'll get a chance to use those further below!

Go back to the following functions that you defined above and redefine
them using one of the higher-order functions map, foldr or para (see
below). These are the only list library functions that you should use
on this problem. If you need any additional helper functions you must
define them yourself (and any helper functions should also use map,
foldr or para instead of explicit recursion).

-- INTERLUDE: para

{-

Now consider a variant of foldr called para. In the case of cons,
foldr provides access to the head of the list and the result of the
fold over the tail of the list. The para function should do the same,
but should also provide access to the tail of the list (before it has
been processed).

-- For example, consider the tails function.
