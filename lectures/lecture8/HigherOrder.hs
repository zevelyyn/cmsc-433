Functions Are Data
==================

As in all functional languages, Haskell functions are *first-class*
values, meaning that they can be treated just as you would any other
data.

You can pass functions around in *any* manner that you can pass any
other data around. For example, suppose you have the simple functions
`plus1` and `minus1` defined via the equations
-}

plus1 :: Int -> Int
plus1 x = x + 1

minus1 :: Int -> Int
minus1 x = x - 1

{-
Now, you can make a pair containing both the functions
-}

funp :: (Int -> Int, Int -> Int)
funp = (plus1, minus1)

{-
Or you can make a list containing the functions
-}

funs :: [Int -> Int]
funs = undefined

{-
Taking Functions as Input
-------------------------

This innocent looking feature makes a language surprisingly brawny and
flexible, because now, we can write *higher-order* functions that take
functions as input and return functions as output!  Consider:
-}

doTwice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
doTwice f x = f (f x)

dtTests :: Test
dtTests =
  TestList
    [ doTwice plus1 4 ~?= 6,
      doTwice minus1 5 ~?= 3
    ]

{-
Here, `doTwice` takes two inputs: a function `f` and value `x`, and
returns the the result of applying `f` to `x`, and feeding that result
back into `f` to get the final output.  Note how the raw code is
clearer to understand than my long-winded English description!

Last time we talked about how programs execute in Haskell: we substitute
 equals-for-equals, just like simplifying equations in math class.

Let's think about an example with `doTwice`:

~~~~~
   doTwice plus1 10   {- unfold doTwice -}

== plus1 (plus1 10)   {- unfold first plus1 -}

== (plus1 10) + 1     {- unfold other plus1 -}

== (10 + 1) + 1       {- old-school arithmetic -}

== 12
~~~~~

What you might infer from this example is that Haskell does not evaluate
  arguments before calling the functions. In other words, we didn't unfold
  `plus1 10` (and simplifiy it to `11`) before unfolding the first call to
  `plus1`. Instead, Haskell waits until we actually need that argument, for
  example, if we need to add it to something.

Executing code in this way is technically called "call-by-name" evaluation. It
is a fine way to think about how Haskell evaluates. Under the covers, the
compiler is a bit smarter though, and will reuse computations when it can
(i.e. "lazy" evaluation).  We won't go into the details of lazy evaluation
today, but be aware that there is a difference in evaluation order between
Haskell and almost every other language that you have seen.

Furthermore, what is great is that in Haskell thinking about evaluation in terms of
substituting equals-for-equals works anywhere. As a result, we could *also* understand
the evaluation of `doTwice` using a more standard order of evaluation.

~~~~~
   doTwice plus1 10   {- unfold doTwice -}

== plus1 (plus1 10)   {- unfold second plus1 -}

== plus1 (10 + 1)     {- old-school arithmetic -}

== plus1 11           {- unfold first plus1 -}

== 11 + 1             {- more arithmetic -}

== 12
~~~~~

or even a hybrid of the two versions!

~~~~~
   doTwice plus1 10   {- unfold doTwice -}

== plus1 (plus1 10)   {- unfold second plus1 -}

== plus1 (10 + 1)     {- unfold first plus1 -}

== (10 + 1) + 1       {- old-school arithmetic -}

== 12
~~~~~

Returning Functions as Output
-----------------------------

Similarly, it can be useful to write functions that return new
functions as output. For example, rather than writing different
versions `plus1`, `plus2`, `plus3`, *etc.* we can write a
single function `plusn` as
-}

plusn :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
plusn n = f
  where
    f x = x + n

{-
That is, `plusn` returns a function `f` which itself
takes as input an integer `x` and adds `n` to it. Lets use it
-}

plus10 :: Int -> Int
plus10 = plusn 10

minus20 :: Int -> Int
minus20 = plusn (-20)

{-
Note the types of the above are `Int -> Int`.  That is, `plus10` and
`minus20` are functions that take in an integer and return an integer
(even though we didn't explicitly give them an argument).
-}

-- >>> plus10 3

{-

-}

-- >>> plusn 10 3

{-
Partial Application
-------------------

In regular arithmetic, the `-` operator is *left-associative*. Hence,

    2 - 1 - 1

is equivalent to

    (2 - 1) - 1

and thus to

    0

(and not `2 - (1 - 1) == 2` !). Just like `-` is an arithmetic operator that
takes two numbers and returns an number, in Haskell, `->` is a *type operator*
that takes two types, the input and output, and returns a new function type.
However, `->` is *right-associative*: the type

    Int -> Int -> Int

is equivalent to

    Int -> (Int -> Int)

That is, the first type (a function which takes two Ints) is in reality a
function that takes a single Int as input, and returns as *output* a function
from `Int` to `Int`! Equipped with this knowledge, consider the function
-}

plus :: Int -> Int -> Int
plus m n = m + n

{-
Thus, whenever we use `plus` we can either pass in both the inputs
at once, as in

    plus 10 20

or instead, we can *partially* apply the function, by just passing in
only one input out of the two that it expects.
-}

plusfive :: Int -> Int
plusfive = plus 5

{-
thereby getting as output a function that is *waiting* for the second
input (at which point it will produce the final result).
-}

pfivetest :: Test
pfivetest = plusfive 1000 ~?= 1005

{-
So how does this execute?  Again *substitute equals for equals*

~~~~~{.haskell}
plusfive 1000 == plus 5 1000       {- definition of plusfive -}
              == 5 + 1000          {- unfold plus -}
              == 1005              {- arithmetic -}
~~~~~

Finally, by now it should be pretty clear that `plusn n` is equivalent
to the partially applied `plus n`.

If you have been following so far, you should know how this behaves.
-}

doTwicePlus20 :: Int -> Int
doTwicePlus20 = doTwice (plus 20)

{-
First, see if you can figure out the type.

Next, see if you can figure out how this evaluates under the "call-by-name"
evaluation order. Remember that this means that you should not evaluate
arguments before substituting them into the body of a defined function.

    doTwicePlus20 0 == doTwice (plus 20) 0        {- unfold doTwice -}
                    == (plus 20) ((plus 20) 0)
                    ... undefined (fill this part in) ...
                    == 20 + 20 + 0
                    == 40

Note that with partial application, that the order of arguments to the function
matters. We can partially apply `plus` to its first argument, but there isn't
a default way to skip that first argument and apply it to the second.

For example, we can easily use partial application to specialize this function
to a particular `Int` (don't bother trying to figure out what it does):
-}

twoArg :: Int -> String -> Bool
twoArg i s = length (s ++ show i) >= 2

{-
thus
-}

oneStringArg :: String -> Bool
oneStringArg = twoArg 3

{-
However, if we wanted to specialize it to a particular `String`, then it is a
bit more clumsy. One solution is to use a library function like `flip` (check
out its type in ghci!) to swap the order of the arguments.
-}

oneIntArg :: Int -> Bool
oneIntArg = flip twoArg "a"

{-
Another solution relies on anonymous functions. (See if you can figure it
out after reading the section below.)

Anonymous Functions
-------------------

As we have seen, with Haskell, it is quite easy to create function values
that are not bound to any name. For example the expression `plus 1000`
yields a function value that doesn't have another way to refer to it.

We will see many situations where a particular function is only used once,
and hence, there is no need to explicitly name it. Haskell provides a
mechanism to create such *anonymous* functions. For example,

    \x -> x + 1

is an expression that corresponds to a function that takes an argument `x` and
returns as output the value `x + 1`. The function has no name, but we can
use it in the same place where we would write a function.

-}

anonTests :: Test
anonTests =
  TestList
    [ (\x -> x + 1) 100 ~?= (101 :: Int),
      doTwice (\x -> x + 1) 100 ~?= (102 :: Int)
    ]

{-
We call this expression form a "lambda expression", inspired by the [lambda
calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). The backslash at
the beginning of the expression is meant to look a little like the greek
letter Î» (lambda) and the `->` between the parameter `x` and the body of
the function is meant to remind you that this expression form creates
a value with a function type.

Of course, we could name the function if we wanted to
-}

plus1' :: Int -> Int
plus1' = \x -> x + 1

{-
Indeed, in general, a function defining equation

    f x1 x2 ... xn = e

is equivalent to

    f = \x1 -> \x2 -> ... \xn -> e

Furthermore, we can also write nested lambda expressions together, with a single
`\` and `->`.

    f = \x1 x2 ... xn -> e

Infix Operations and Sections
-----------------------------

In order to improve readability, Haskell allows you to use certain functions as
*infix* operators: an infix operator is a function whose name is made of
symbols. Wrapping it in parentheses makes it a regular identifier.
My personal favorite infix operator is the application function,
defined like this:

    ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
    f $ x = f x

Huh?  Doesn't seem so compelling does it?  It's just application.

Actually, this operator is very handy because infix operators have different precedence than
normal application.  For example, I can write:

    minus20 $ plus 30 32

Which means the same as:

    minus20 (plus 30 32)

That is, Haskell interprets everything after the `$` as one argument to
`minus20`.  I could *not* do this by writing

    minus20 plus 30 32    --- WRONG!

because Haskell would think this was the application of `minus20` to the
three separate arguments `plus`, `30` and `32`.

It is often not a big deal whether one uses the `($)` operator or parentheses
and it mostly comes down to a matter of taste. The operator can come in handy
in certain situations, but it is always possible to write code without using
it.

We will see many infix operators in the course of the class; indeed we have already
seen some defined in the standard prelude. For example, list `cons`truction

    (:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]

as well as the arithmetic operators `(+)`, `(*)` and `(-)`.

Recall also that Haskell allows you to use *any* function as an infix
operator, simply by wrapping it inside backticks.
-}

anotherFive :: Int
anotherFive = 2 `plus` 3

{-
To further improve readability, Haskell allows you to use *partially applied*
infix operators, i.e. infix operators with only a single argument.
These are called *sections*. Thus, the section `(+1)` is simply a function that
takes as input a number, the argument missing on the left of the `+` and
returns that number plus `1`.
-}

anotherFour :: Int
anotherFour = doTwice (+ 2) 0

{-
Similarly, the section `(1:)` takes a list of numbers and returns a
new list with `1` followed by the input list.   So

    doTwice (1:) [2..5]

evaluates to `[1,1,2,3,4,5]`.

For practice, define the singleton operation as a section, so that the
following test passes.
-}

singleton :: a -> [a]
singleton = (: [])

singletonTest :: Test
singletonTest = singleton True ~?= [True]

{-
One exception to sections is subtraction. `(-1)` is the integer "minus one",
not a section subtracting `1` from its argument. Instead of a section, you can
write `\x -> x - 1` or `subtract 1` (`subtract` is a function from the standard
library).

Polymorphism
============

We used `doTwice` to repeat an arithmetic operation, but the actual body
of the function is oblivious to how `f` behaves.

We say that `doTwice` is *polymorphic*: it works with different types of
values, e.g. functions that increment integers and concatenate strings.
This is vital for *abstraction*.  The general notion of repeating, i.e. *doing
twice* is entirely independent from the types of the operation that is being
repeated, and so we shouldn't have to write separate repeaters for integers and
strings.
Polymorphism allows us to *reuse* the same abstraction `doTwice` in different
settings.

Of course, with great power, comes great responsibility.

The section `(10 <)` takes an integer and returns `True`
iff the integer is greater than `10`:
-}

greaterThan10 :: Int -> Bool
greaterThan10 = (10 <)

{-
However, because the input and output types are different, it doesn't
make sense to try `doTwice greaterThan10`.  A quick glance at the type
of doTwice would tell us this:

    doTwice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a

The `a` above is a *type variable*. The signature above states that
the first argument to `doTwice` must be a function that maps values of
type `a` to `a`, i.e. it must produce an output that has the same type
as its input (so that that output can be fed into the function again!).
The second argument must also be an `a` at which point we may are
guaranteed that the result from `doTwice` will also be an `a`. The
above holds for *any* `a` which allows us to safely re-use `doTwice`
in different settings.

Of course, if the input and output type of the input function are
different, as in `greaterThan10`, then the function is incompatible
with `doTwice`.

Ok, to make sure you're following, can you figure out what this does?
-}

ex1 :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
ex1 x y = doTwice doTwice x y

{-

-}

ex1Test :: Test
ex1Test = undefined

{-
Polymorphic Data Structures
---------------------------

Polymorphic functions that can *operate* on different kinds of values are
often associated with polymorphic data structures that can *contain*
different kinds of values.  The types of such functions and data structures
are written with one or more type variables.

For example, the list length function:
-}

len :: [a] -> Int
len [] = 0
len (_ : xs) = 1 + len xs

{-
The function's type states that we can invoke `len` on any kind of list.
The type variable `a` is a placeholder that is replaced with the actual type
of the list elements at different application sites.  Thus, in the following
applications of `len`, `a` is replaced with `Double`, `Char` and `[Int]`
respectively.

     len [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4] :: Int

     len "mmm donuts!"  :: Int

     len [[], [1], [1,2], [1,2,3]] :: Int

Most of the standard list manipulating functions, for example those in the
module [`Data.List`][1], have generic types.  With a little practice, you'll
find that the type signature contains a surprising amount of information about
how the function behaves.

In particular, note that we cannot "fake" values of generic types. For
example, try to replace the `undefined` below with a result that doesn't throw
an exception (like `undefined` does) or go into an infinite loop.  (N.B.: Using
a function that starts with `unsafe` doesn't count.)
-}

impossible :: a
impossible = undefined

{-
Because `impossible` has to have *any* type, there is no real value that we
can provide for it.  This type says that 'impossible' has *whatever* type you
want it to have---i.e. the type system will allow you do do anything with
'impossible', such as add it to another number
-}

ok1 :: Int
ok1 = impossible + 1

{-
concatenate it to a `String`
-}

ok2 :: String
ok2 = "Hello" ++ impossible

{-
or test it like a boolean
-}

ok3 :: String
ok3 = if impossible then "a" else "b"

{-
This reasoning extends to other types too. For example, the generic type of
the const function

    const :: a -> b -> a

tells us that the output of this function (if there is any) must be the first
argument. There is no other way to produce a generic result of type 'a'. (And
the second argument must be completely ignored, there is no way to use it in a
generic way.)

"Bottling" Computation Patterns With Polymorphic Higher-Order Functions
=======================================================================

The combination of polymorphism and higher-order functions is the secret
sauce that makes FP so tasty.  It allows us to take *patterns of computation*
that reappear in different guises in different places, and crisply specify them
as reusable strategies.  Let's look at some concrete examples...

Computation Pattern: Iteration
------------------------------

Let's write a function that converts a string to uppercase.  Recall that, in
Haskell, a `String` is nothing but a list of `Char`s.  So we must start with
a function that will convert an individual `Char` to its uppercase
version. Once we find this function, we will simply *walk over the list*,
and apply the function to each `Char`.

How might we find such a transformer?  Lets query [Hoogle][2] for a function
of the appropriate type!  Ah, we see that the module [`Data.Char`][3]
contains such a function:

    toUpper :: Char -> Char

Using this, we can write a simple recursive function that does what we need:
-}

toUpperString :: String -> String
toUpperString [] = []
toUpperString (x : xs) = toUpper x : toUpperString xs

{-
This pattern of recursion appears all over the place.  For example,
suppose we represent a location on the plane using a pair of `Double`s (for
the x- and y- coordinates) and we have a list of points that represent a
polygon.
-}

type XY = (Double, Double)

type Polygon = [XY]

{-
It's easy to write a function that *shifts* a point by a specific amount:
-}

shiftXY :: XY -> XY -> XY
shiftXY (dx, dy) (x, y) = (x + dx, y + dy)

{-
How would we translate a polygon?  Just walk over all the points in
the polygon and translate them individually.
-}

shiftPoly :: XY -> Polygon -> Polygon
shiftPoly _ [] = []
shiftPoly d (xy : xys) = shiftXY d xy : shiftPoly d xys

{-
Now, some people (using some languages) might be quite happy with the above
code. But what separates a good programmer from a great one is the ability
to *abstract*.

The functions `toUpperString` and `shiftPoly` share the same computational
structure: they walk over a list and apply a function to each element.  We
can abstract this common pattern out as a higher-order function, `map`.
Since the two functions we're abstracting differ only in what they do to
each list element, so we'll just take that as an input!
-}

map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x : xs) = f x : map f xs

{-
The type of `map` tells us exactly what it does: it takes an `a -> b`
transformer and list of `a` values, and transforms each `a` value to return
a list of `b` values.  We can now safely reuse the pattern, by
*instantiating* the transformer with different specific operations.
-}

toUpperString' :: String -> String
toUpperString' xs = map toUpper xs

shiftPoly' :: XY -> Polygon -> Polygon
shiftPoly' d = map $ shiftXY d

{-
Much better.  But let's make sure our refactoring didn't break anything!
-}

testMap :: Test
testMap =
  TestList
    [ toUpperString' "abc" ~?= toUpperString "abc",
      shiftPoly' (0.5, 0.5) [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]
        ~?= shiftPoly (0.5, 0.5) [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]
    ]

{-
By the way, what happened to the list parameters of `toUpperString`
and `shiftPoly`?  Two words: *partial application*.  In general, in
Haskell, a function definition equation

    f x = e x

is identical to

    f = e

as long as `x` isn't used in `e`.  Thus, to save ourselves the
trouble of typing, and the blight of seeing the vestigial `x`, we
often prefer to just leave it out altogether.

(As an exercise, you may like to prove to yourself using just equational
reasoning, using the equality laws we have seen, that the above versions of
`toUpperString` and `shiftPoly` are equivalent.)

We've already seen a few other examples of the map pattern.  Recall the
`listIncr` function, which added 1 to each element of a list:
-}

listIncr :: [Int] -> [Int]
listIncr [] = []
listIncr (x : xs) = (x + 1) : listIncr xs

{-
We can write this more cleanly with map, of course:
-}

listIncr' :: [Int] -> [Int]
listIncr' = map (+1) 

{-
Computation Pattern: Folding
----------------------------

Once you've put on the FP goggles, you start seeing a handful of computation
patterns popping up everywhere.  Here's another...

Lets write a function that *adds* all the elements of a list.
-}

sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum [] = 0
sum (x : xs) = x + sum xs

{-
Next, a function that *multiplies* the elements of a list.
-}

product :: [Int] -> Int
product [] = 1
product (x : xs) = x * product xs

{-
Can you see the pattern?  Again, the only bits that are different are
the `base` case value, and the function being used to combine the list
element with the recursive result at each step.  We'll just turn those
into parameters, and lo!
-}

foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr _f base [] = base
foldr f base (x : xs) = x `f` foldr f base xs
{- $ == `_` == (_) -}

{-
Now, each of the individual functions are just specific instances of the
general `foldr` pattern.
-}

sum', product' :: [Int] -> Int
sum' = foldr (+) 0
product' = foldr (*) 1

testFoldr :: Test
testFoldr =
  TestList
    [ sum' [1, 2, 3] ~?= sum [1, 2, 3],
      product' [1, 2, 3] ~?= product [1, 2, 3]
    ]

{-
To develop some intuition about `foldr` let's unfold an example a few
times by hand. In Haskell, we can substitute equals-for-equals anywhere
so we can unfold definitions eagerly if we want.

~~~~~
foldr f base [x1,x2,...,xn]

  == f x1 (foldr f base [x2,...,xn])           {- unfold foldr -}

  == f x1 (f x2 (foldr f base [...,xn]))       {- unfold foldr -}

  == x1 `f` (x2 `f` ... (xn `f` base))

~~~~~

Aha!  It has a rather pleasing structure that mirrors that of lists;
the `:` is replaced by the `f` and the `[]` is replaced by `base`.  So
can you see how to use it to eliminate recursion from the recursion
from our list-length function?

    len :: [a] -> Int
    len []     = 0
    len (x:xs) = 1 + len xs
-}

len' :: [a] -> Int
len' = foldr (const (1+)) 0
{- (+1) and (1+) are the same because plus is communative -}

{-
Once you have defined `len` in this way, see if you can trace how it
works on a small example:

~~~~~~~~~
len' (1:2:[]) == foldr (\x y -> 1 + y) 0 (1:2:[])
              == (\x y -> 1 + y) 1 (foldr (\x y -> 1 + y) 0 (2:[]))
       ...
              == 2
~~~~~~~~~

Or, how would you use foldr to eliminate the recursion from this?
-}

factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n -1)

factorial' :: Int -> Int
factorial' n = product [1..n]

{-
OK, one more.  The standard list library function `filter` has this
type:
-}

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
{-
The idea is that it the output list should contain only the elements
of the first list for which the input function returns `True`.

So:
-}

testFilter :: Test
testFilter =
  TestList
    [ filter (> 10) [1 .. 20] ~?= ([11 .. 20] :: [Int]),
      filter (\l -> sum l <= 42) [[10, 20], [50, 50], [1 .. 5]] ~?= [[10, 20], [1 .. 5]]
    ]
{-
Can we implement filter using foldr?  Sure!
-}

filter pred [] = []
filder pred (x : xs)
  (if pred x then [x] else []) ++ (filter pred xs)
{-
  | pred x = x : filter pred xs {- if -}
  | otherwise = filter pred xs {- else -}
-}
  
{- 
layout: foldr (\a b -> _b) b 
then, folder (\a -> b -> _b) b
-}
filter pred = foldr (\a -> if pred a then (a:) else id) []

runTests :: IO Counts
runTests = runTestTT $ TestList [testMap, testFoldr, testFilter]

{-
Which is more readable? HOFs or Recursion
-----------------------------------------

As a beginner, you might find the explicitly recursive versions of
some of these functions easier to follow than the `map` and `foldr`
versions.  However, as you write more Haskell, you will probably start
to find the latter are far easier, because `map` and `foldr`
encapsulate such common patterns that you'll become completely
accustomed to thinking in terms of them and other similar
abstractions.

In contrast, explicitly writing out the recursive pattern matching
should start to feel needlessly low-level. Every time you see a
recursive function, you have to understand how the knots are tied --
and worse, there is potential for making silly off-by-one type errors
if you re-jigger the basic strategy every time.

As an added bonus, it can be quite useful and profitable to
*parallelize* and *distribute* the computation patterns (like `map`
and `foldr`) in just one place, thereby allowing arbitrary hundreds or
thousands of instances to benefit in a single shot! Haskell doesn't
do this out of the box, but these ideas readily translate to languages
designed for [parallel computation][4].

We'll see some other similar patterns later on.
